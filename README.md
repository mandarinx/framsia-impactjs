A presentation of ImpactJS for the Framsia event held in November 2012.

For this to work, you would need the Impact engine. Buy it at [impactjs.com](http://impactjs.com/) and then drop the engine in the App/lib directory.

To make an iOS build running on your iOS device, you need to set up a provisioning profile. This can easily be done at the Apple Developer website.
